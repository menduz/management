# Guidance

> This is a sane default on how an engineer should behave. I have anedoctal belief that, by doing this, a person will be a nice team player, and walk towards constant growth on their career. On the beginning of our story together, we'd go through the items on this list, remove the items that don't make sense for you, and write new ones you'd like to add.

*be the person you want to work with, be the change you want to see (lead by example), and constantly challenge your work*

- In general, talk to others! Especially people you won't normally talk to (outside of team/chapter etc). Make an effort to get out of your comfort zone. Ask people from other teams what they've been doing. It's a great way to get non-obvious business context, beyond corporate large-scale meetings that won't always convey the whole picture. Also a great way to grow your professional network, learn of other people who had similar problems and such.
- Share what you think about things. Don't be too quiet on meetings. Help people get to know you better.
- Disagree constructively and respectfully - keep in mind that people will sometimes think different, but everyone is doing the best they can given the situation at hand.
- Help your peers grow, too - show them the new thing you're learning, keyboard shortcuts, command line fu. Also give them good feedback on how they can do things better or do more things they're not doing yet.
- Don't be the coder in the corner - try to help everyone understand what you're doing (and what you're not doing) and why.
- Don't make big decisions alone - always doubt yourself, present your train of thought, talk about the options you considered and why you think that's the best thing to be done at the moment. And hear their answer.
- Be aware of your psychological biases (see the section "Mature engineers are aware of cognitive biases" at [kitchensoap's On being a Senior Engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)).
- Take the initiative to change things you wish were done differently, then proactively seek feedback ("you are excrement, you can change yourself into gold" - Alexandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain). Proactively seeking feedback when you do this is important to understand if what you've done was really better or not!
- Don't do things you don't like when others do, do things you'd like others to do. Fix that flaky alert, raise the subject about the elephant in the room on your team, do the right thingÂ®. We all know what is is, but sometimes we'll avoid doing it. It's awesome when we do - people come thank us and say nice things.
- Praise good behavior publicly, criticize bad behavior privately - it's ok if you prefer to talk to someone else before doing that to practice how the message will go through. It's better than doing nothing.
- Don't let your ego take over your work; your work can change the world; your ego not so much. Practice [egoless programming](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/).
- Expose your ignorance; don't be afraid to make it clear to others what you don't understand. Try to get good at asking for help. Julia Evans has a pretty good blog post about it: https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/
- Give yourself the opportunity to fail - it's often the only way to learn new things. Don't worry, be crappy! Don't be afraid to pick a task you have no idea how to execute.
- Question why you're doing what you're doing - is it the best use of your time? Is it the best thing for the business? Not every problem needs to be solved now, or even be solved at all - solve the right ones at the right time. Leave tomorrow's problems for tomorrow.
- Be responsible for the code you ship: monitor stuff, avoid shipping and leaving. Validate no error rate has increased, no big latency hits have happened.
- Always be the first to review your code (it's likely the best review it'll get).
- Write good commit messages (pull request descriptions also help, but they tend to get lost over time).
- Embrace chaos - humans are chaotic beings, and teams are made of humans. As engineers we tend to like well-designed things, but every company is either attempting to come up with the right organization (which is an iterative process that's never perfect and never over) or thinks they've come up with the right organization (which is very likely to be a wrong assumption, resulting in a suboptimal communication structure). People and interactions will always be more important than processes and tools.
