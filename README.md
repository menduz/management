# rafaelzlisboa's management text files

Hey! If you're reading this, chances are I'm helping you as a leader or as a peer. I really hope my work - plus some of the stuff in here - can be useful to you.

You can take a look at [`guidance.md`](guidance.md) - although it's going to be better for us to go through it together on a 1:1. Speak of it, [`wanowans.md`](wanowans.md) describes what to more or less expect from our 1:1 conversations (and our relationship in general). Also, often we'll refer to the [`reads.md`](reads.md) to gear up on something you want to focus on.
