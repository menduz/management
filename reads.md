# Reads

This is a list of references that I recommend. It is NEVER, EVER going to be complete.

- Clean Code (https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) for code quality.
- Pragmatic Programmer (https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) for code quality/architecture and some general engineering principles.
- The Agile Samurai (https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Samurai-Software-Pragmatic-Programmers-ebook/dp/B00AYQNR5K) for understanding Agile tools and practices to be used on your work and on a team, and a bit about writing software on an agile environment.
- Julia Evans' zines and blog posts are in general really good references from "how to work on a team and how to deal with impostor syndrome" to unix commands. I'm highlighting a few:
    - Getting things done - https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/09/19/getting-things-done/
    - How do you decide what to work on? - https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/
    - How to ask good questions/ask for help - https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/
    - Help! I have a manager! (nice zine about how to use your manager) - https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/22/new-zine--help--i-have-a-manager/
    - What's a senior engineer's job? https://jvns.ca/blog/senior-engineer/
- Defining a distinguished engineer - https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/defining-a-distinguished-engineer/
- Things I learnt the hard way - https://blog.juliobiason.net/thoughts/things-i-learnt-the-hard-way/ - about workflow/development principles/behavior
- The ten commandments of Egoless Programming - https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/
- The Manager's Path - https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897 - even if you don't want to be a manager, the first few chapters are useful for e.g. how to have a useful relationship with your manager and how to welcome new engineers to your team.
- If you're at the beginning of your career, Apprenticeship Patterns (https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) for how to go about learning, growing and sustaining your life as an engineer.
- If you're starting on the manager journey, Radical Candor (https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE) is a good read about how to give guidance and nurture relationships with the people you help. (There are also videos of the author, Kim Scott, talking about this framework on YouTube).
- Also about management, An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management (https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186) is a pretty complete reference on very diverse matters related to managing an engineering organization. It feels like talking to someone who's gone through a lot and is going to give many tools to solve challenges you're bound to face.
- Release It! (https://www.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395) for people designing and maintaining more mature projects. It introduces stability practices such as circuit breakers, bulkheads etc on a real-life way through case studies.
- Building Microservices (https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/dp/1491950358) for operating in a "microserviceful" environment. It's pretty complete, even talking about service ownership, how teams interact and so on.
- We're all designers of our own lives. We also design many things, be them processes, our homes, public APIs, function parameters, domain terms or customer journeys. To build this very important skillset, I recommend The Design of Everyday Things (https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654).
- Most people suck at negotiating salaries. This read was really good in order to suck less: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/
