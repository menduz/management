# Wanowans with me

By default, this is the kind of stuff we talk about:

- What's been on your mind lately?
- How's your energy? How's your team's energy? Are you feeling productive? What are you most excited about? What are you most worried about?
- What stones can I help you push? Anything you need? How can I help you?
- Ideas for changes - processes, team or more broadly in the company?
- How are you feeling about your overall development? Career goals and aspirations?
- What feedback do you have for me?

# Guidelines

1. Use the time however you need.
Although there are some default questions above, keep in mind that I'm available to talk about anything - be it technical, personal, coaching, mentoring, music gear, videogames, carnivorous plants etc.
In the (possibly very likely) occasion that I'm not able to help, I can connect you with someone else who can, or carve paths to make this happen.

2. Don't feel forced to use this time if you don't need.
It's not a problem if you don't have anything new to talk about. This is perfectly normal sometimes.
(Do take a look at the questions and see if there isn't anything we're forgetting, though)

3. Don't wait for the next wanowan if something urgent comes up.
When suddenly something happens that drains your energy, or something concerns you a lot, or gives you big anxiety, don't wait for the next ritual - just grab me for a chat.

4. Take the questions as a default, but do feel free to suggest other structures for our 1:1s - you're the owner of the ritual and we'll do whatever works for you.
